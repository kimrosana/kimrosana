- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Rosana Kim a.k.a. @kimrosana! Welcome to my profile :)
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in music, crossword puzzles, comedy TV shows, reading and - of course, data! I use it to better understand the world we live in, being able to get insights from it and answer questions.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently developing my Power BI and SQL skills, and learning Python bit by bit. On this profile, you will find personal projects that showcase my skills.
- ðŸ“« You can reach out to me via LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/rosana-kim/
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm Brazilian-Korean, and was an ESL teacher who graduated in German Language and Literature before I found out my passion for data!
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/She
